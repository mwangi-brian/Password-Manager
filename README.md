## Overview

This password manager is a free, cross-platform desktop tool that helps you securely store passwords for various websites and applications.

We all know the struggle of creating passwords in a hurry, forgetting them later, and facing the hassle of password resets. This tool eliminates that problem! Simply sign up for a free account and save an unlimited number of passwords. You can even generate strong passwords for added security.

## Security
#### Your data security is our top priority. Here's how we safeguard your information:

 - All your data, including usernames, emails, and passwords, is encrypted before being stored in a secure database.
 - Only you can access your saved passwords using unique decryption keys only available to you.<br>

 If you have any security concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the server developer, **Brian Mwangi**, on [**X**.](https://x.com/brianmwangi_)
